# Food Sales prediction 

## About

This is a repository which coatin my work using Data Science Model to predict the future sale of a store base on the [data]() given

I have made a power [point presntation]() and a [video presentation]() 

In the end I was able to get a Random Forest Three to have r2 score of test data. 

## Processing the Data

To process the data I seach for any misslabel data and missing data. 

1. for the missed label data to was abel to change it to the corresct values

2. for the missing data I was abtl to impute it based on the correlation with other data 


## Model

I was able to compute multiple model which gave me difrent results on the testing data

### Decision Tree

Decision Tree with a depth of 5 gave me an accuracy of 0.59 

### Random Forest 

Random Forest with a depth of 5 gave me an accuracy of 0.6
