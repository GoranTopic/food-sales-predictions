# Food Sales prediction 

## About

This is a repository which coatin my work using Data Science Model to predict the future sale of a store base on the [data]('https://github.com/GoranTopic/food-sales-predictions/blob/master/Data/sales_predictions.csv') given

I have made a power [point presentation]('https://github.com/GoranTopic/food-sales-predictions/blob/master/presentation/food-prediction_powerpoint.odp') and a [video presentation 1]('https://github.com/GoranTopic/food-sales-predictions/blob/master/presentation/presentation_1.mp4') and [video presentation 2]('https://github.com/GoranTopic/food-sales-predictions/blob/master/presentation/presentation_2.mp4') 

In the end I was able to get a Random Forest Three to have r2 score of test data. 

## Processing the Data

To process the data I seach for any misslabel data and missing data. 

1. for the missed label data to was abel to change it to the corresct values

2. for the missing data I was abtl to impute it based on the correlation with other data 


## Model

I was able to compute multiple model which gave me difrent results on the testing data

### Decision Tree

Decision Tree with a depth of 5 gave me an accuracy of 0.59 

### Random Forest 

Random Forest with a depth of 5 gave me an accuracy of 0.6
